He was was able to independently learn new topics quickly, and I found he was always willing to tutor other students. Kary's learning didn't stop in the classroom, he would go home after class to get a head start on other labs and upcoming learnings for that week. While I can only speak to Kary's ability within the classroom setting, it was clear to me that his passion in software development went beyond achieving the basic guidelines set out for him. Rather, Kary consistently created projects that raised the standard of what a student could accomplish in the bootcamp setting.`,

He was an independent learner and I found him very self-sufficient in facing various learning challenges. Kary worked well in teams, contributing ideas and taking responsibility for his tasks. I was very happy with his performance in the program, and ongoing learning he has continued after the program through collaborations with other students and personal side projects. I would highly recommend Kary for an entry-level web developer position, and know that he will be a strong addition to any web development team who will grow quickly.`,
